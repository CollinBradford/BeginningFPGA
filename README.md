# BeginningFPGA

Welcome! I am a student working at Fermilab helping to develop a data aquisition system using FPGA's. For purposes of documentation, I have been commishioned to write a set of instructionals and documentation pages explaning the project as I go along.  This section is for starting out as a beginner programmer.  The two tutorials here will help you get started using the Mojo Development board from Embedded Micro.  I consider this the "Arduino" of FPGAs.  The thing that sets this tutorial apart from others is that we will be using VHDL which is not natively supported in the Mojo Development Enviornment.  In this tutorial, I will be focusing more on how to get started using the development enviornment.  Although I am not going to teach much VHDL or digital design, I will link to plenty of resources for you to use.
