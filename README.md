# BeginningFPGA
This repository contains code and instructions for simple projects to help people get started programming FPGA's.  

The code and instructions here are basically to get you started if you are a frist time programmer.  I am going to point you to some resources, products, and tutorials to help you get started.  We will mainly focus on using the Mojo Development board from Embedbded Micro.  I consider this the "Arduino" of FPGA's.  Since the tutorial series is going to be written in VHDL, I will show you how to program the Mojo using the ISE Design Suite from Xilinx along with the Mojo Loader.
