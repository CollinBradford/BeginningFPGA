# Beginning FPGA

Welcome! I am a student working at Fermilab helping to develop a data acquisition system using FPGA's. For purposes of documentation, I have been commissioned to write a set of instructions and documentation pages explaining the project as I go along.  This section is for starting out as a beginner programmer.  The two tutorials here will help you get started using the Mojo Development board from Embedded Micro.  The thing that sets this tutorial apart from others is that we will be using VHDL which is not natively supported in the Mojo Development Environment.  In this tutorial, I will be focusing more on how to get started using the development environment than on the programming aspect.  Although I am not going to teach much VHDL or digital design, I will link to plenty of resources for you to use.  

The tutorials should be performed in this order:  

1. The Basicsâ€”Feat: Mojo FPGA
2. Hello World!
